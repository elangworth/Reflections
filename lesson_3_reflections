When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  This is handy when using multiple computers to work on the same project or when you have multiple people working on the same project. 
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  It is nice having things in the cloud just in case something happens to your computer. You don't have to worry about losing your project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks are essentially clones but only on github. clones are pulled from github or other repositories on your local machine.
  Branches are different paths from your master that also include the master.
